    <strong>About Us</strong>
  </h1>
  <p align="left">Our engineer Carter Konz is a musician, audio-geek, and software developer.
                  He recieved a degree in Computer Science from Loyola University Chicago in 2017,
                  where he had the opportunity to practice audio engineering in conjunction with
                  formal Computer Science training. A strong background with computers and technology
                  provides him a unique, workflow-driven, audio engineering skill set. In addition to
                  a creative and musical ear, Carter's technical training has enabled him to develop
                  a reliable, streamlined engineering workflow that eliminates technical issues so
                  that your music can come first.</p>
  <p align="left">Originally from Minneapolis, MN– Carter has had the opportunity to work with a
                  variety of artists in the Chicago and Minneapolis music communities. From folk
                  to hip-hop and R&B, he has honed his skills, not within a specific genre, but
                  in artist communication and collaboration. Our aim at <strong>Nº Shore</strong>
                  is to work with the individual artist to understand their sonic vision and get it
                  out of their heads and onto the record. We do this by providing a confortable
                  environment and developing a strong relationship with each artist to establish
                  trust in the recording and mixing process, ensuring effective communication and
                  true collaboration.</p>
